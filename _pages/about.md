I am a second-year PhD student at the Centre for Machine Intelligence and Data Science, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
I am supervised by Prof. Biplab Banerjee, Prof. Subhashis Chaudhuri, and Prof. Gemma Roig (Goethe University, Frankfurt). I work on Computer Vision problems related to Domain Adaptation, Domain Generalization and related topics in a continually changing scenario.

Prior to joining my PhD, I did my Master's from the Indian Institute of Technology, Patna, under the supervision of Prof. Asif Ekbal. I worked on a variety of problems related to Medical imaging (Thesis topic) and code summarization (AI for Code). 

ðŸ¥ˆ I received the Institute Silver Medal for being the department topper in the Computer Science and Engineering department.

I completed my Bachelor's study in 2021, in Computer Science and Engineering from the Government College of Engineering and Leather Technology, Kolkata, where I was fortunate to work under the supervision of Prof. Debayan Ganguly.
