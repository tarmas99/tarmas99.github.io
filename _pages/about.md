I am a second-year PhD student at the Centre for Machine Intelligence and Data Science, Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
I am supervised by Prof. Biplab Banerjee, Prof. Subhashis Chaudhuri, and Prof. Gemma Roig (Goethe University, Frankfurt). I work on Computer Vision problems related to Domain Adaptation, Domain Generalization and related topics in a continually changing scenario.

Prior to joining my PhD, I did my Master's from the Indian Institute of Technology, Patna, under the supervision of Prof. Asif Ekbal. I worked on a variety of problems related to Medical imaging (Thesis topic) and code summarization (AI for Code).
